Are there caveats in Power BI Anomaly Detection?

The Power BI anomaly detection algorithm which runs on time series data marks some of the data points as anomalies, whereas a close examination of data will reveal 
that they are factual. In my opinion, anomalies cannot be detected with single data points. To detect anomalies few additional conditions or prerequisites are required. 
For e.g. in this hospital billing system calculation, we need to see whether the value is influenced by certain disease or factors like disease outbreak etc. 

What is your opinion or any pointer in dealing with anomalies in your organisation?
