Is there a caveats in Power BI Anomaly Detection?

The Power BI anomaly detection algorithm which runs on time series data marks some of the data points as anomalies, whereas a close examination of data will reveal 
that they are factual. In my opinon, anomalies cannot be detected with single data points. To detect anomalties few additional conditions or prerequisites are required. 
For e.g. in this billing system calculation we need to see whether the value are within the range of disease or any external factors i.e. disease outbreak etc. 

What is your opinion or any pointer in dealing anomalites in your organisation?
